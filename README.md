# Anchors for DICE

Anchors add a trust-governed working memory layer on top of DICE + Embabel so long-running chats don’t silently drift.

## 1. The Problem

LLMs degrade in multi-turn conversations. [Laban et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120) measured across 200,000+ simulated conversations with 15 LLMs: a 39% average performance drop from single-turn to multi-turn settings, a 112% increase in unreliability (variance between best and worst runs), with degradation starting at 2+ turns regardless of information density. Models prematurely attempt solutions with incomplete information and then over-rely on those early attempts. Temperature reduction to 0.0 eliminates single-turn unreliability but 30%+ unreliability persists in multi-turn. The root cause is not context capacity but the absence of any mechanism to distinguish **load-bearing facts** from ambient context.

Standard mitigations fall short:

| Approach               | Why it fails                                                                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Longer context windows | More tokens does not mean better attention. Lost-in-the-middle effects persist.          |
| Summarization          | Lossy. Recursive summarization compounds errors.                                         |
| RAG                    | Retrieves relevant content but does not mandate consistency. No enforcement.             |
| Prompt engineering     | "Remember these facts" degrades as context grows. Vulnerable to confident contradiction. |

The problem is acute in agentic systems where invariants must hold across long horizons under adversarial pressure. A dead NPC must stay dead. A drug allergy must never be forgotten. A legal privilege must never be waived.

### Why D&D as a Test Domain

This project uses tabletop RPGs as its proving ground, but the approach is domain-agnostic. D&D is a particularly useful sandbox because:

- **Invariants are legible.** World facts, character states, and rules form a clear set of constraints. A dead NPC stays dead (barring necromancy shenanigans). Violations are immediately obvious.
- **Creative freedom is the point.** The value of the LLM is improvisation, elaboration, and responsive storytelling. Restricting this defeats the purpose.
- **Adversarial pressure is natural.** Players routinely test boundaries, make false claims, and try to manipulate the narrative — providing organic adversarial testing that mirrors real-world prompt injection concerns.
- **Long horizons are the norm.** Campaigns span dozens of sessions. Facts established early must persist across hundreds of turns.

This tension — *be creative, but don't break the rules* — exists wherever agentic systems operate within constraints.

## What are Anchors?

LLMs are great at continuation, not persistence. In long-running conversations, facts that *should* stay stable slowly degrade as new turns reweight attention. That’s fine for creativity; it’s a problem when you’re trying to preserve rules, world state, decisions, or any other “we already settled this” constraints.

**Anchors** are promoted [DICE](https://github.com/embabel/dice) propositions with extra control fields:

- **Rank** — importance under memory pressure
- **Authority** — trust level (PROVISIONAL ↔ UNRELIABLE ↔ RELIABLE ↔ CANON); bidirectional with invariant guards
- **Authority ceiling** — the highest level this fact can auto-reach based on provenance
- **Budget membership** — explicit inclusion in a bounded working set (default: max 20 active anchors)

At runtime, anchors are injected into every prompt as a ranked reference block. That makes memory an explicit, governed mechanism instead of an accidental side effect:

- conflict checks gate contradictory updates
- trust scoring gates promotion and authority movement
- budget enforcement evicts low-value anchors first
- reinforcement/decay updates importance over time

Knowledge graphs answer “what facts exist.” Anchors answer “what must stay salient and trusted *right now*.” That distinction is the whole point.

### Design Decisions

**Explicit state over implicit memory.** Facts are managed state with rank, authority, and provenance rather than raw conversation history the model must parse.

**Authority tiers as governance primitive.** A four-level hierarchy creates policy hooks unavailable in flat retrieval stacks. Bidirectional transitions with invariant guards prevent both adversarial downgrade and unauthorized escalation.

**Hard budget enforcement.** A cap (default 20 active anchors) prevents context bloat. Long-context capability does not remove attention-allocation failures. A small, focused fact set outperforms a large dump.

**Adversarial resistance by design.** Anchors are formatted as authoritative instructions with explicit correction directives. The model is told to *actively resist* contradiction attempts, not merely recall facts.

**Mandatory injection over retrieval.** Unlike RAG (retrieved content competes for attention) or summarization (content may be dropped), anchors occupy a fixed system-prompt block injected before the user message.

## Why DICE + Embabel?

This repo is an extension layer, not a replacement stack:

- **DICE** handles proposition extraction, grounding, and graph persistence.
- **Embabel** handles agent orchestration plus prompt/action lifecycle integration.
- **Anchors** adds trust/authority governance and bounded working-memory control (where base proposition systems are intentionally neutral).

Practically: DICE/Embabel handle acquisition and flow; Anchors handles memory prioritization, trust-constrained mutation, and drift resistance.

## Architecture Overview

### Chat Flow

```text
ChatView (user types)
  → ChatActions (Embabel @EmbabelComponent)
  → AnchorsLlmReference (inject anchors into system prompt)
  → LLM (gpt-4.1-mini) + PromptBudgetEnforcer (token limits)
  → Extract propositions (DICE extraction)
  → AnchorPromoter (promote promising propositions to anchors)
  → AnchorEngine (reinforce existing anchors, manage budget)
  → Neo4j persistence (Drivine ORM)
```

### Simulation Flow

```text
SimulationView (user selects scenario and hits "Run")
  → SimulationService (load scenario YAML, seed anchors, phase state machine)
  → SimulationTurnExecutor (per turn):
     - Assemble anchor + system/user prompts
     - Call LLM (DM response)
     - If ATTACK turn: evaluate drift against ground truth (concurrent)
     - Extract propositions from DM response (concurrent)
     - Promote extracted propositions (concurrent)
  → Adversary strategy (adaptive or scripted from scenario YAML)
  → LLM again (generate adversarial player message)
  → Repeat until scenario ends
  → SimulationView updates with final anchor state, drift verdicts, and rankings
```

## Key Features

### Anchor Lifecycle

An **Anchor** is a fact promoted to special status in the LLM’s context:

- **Rank** `[100–900]` — higher rank = more influence under budget pressure
- **Authority** — PROVISIONAL → UNRELIABLE → RELIABLE → CANON (bidirectional — promoted via reinforcement, demoted via decay/trust re-evaluation; CANON is never auto-assigned and immune to auto-demotion)
- **Reinforcement tracking** — reuse boosts rank and may upgrade authority
- **Decay** — unused anchors decay exponentially; eventually auto-archived at `MIN_RANK`
- **Budget enforcement** — max 20 active anchors; evicts lowest-ranked non-pinned when exceeded

### Trust Pipeline

`TrustPipeline` evaluates propositions through multiple trust signals before promotion:

- source authority assessment
- extraction confidence scoring
- reinforcement history tracking
- `TrustAuditRecord` captures the decision trail
- domain-specific invariant rules via `InvariantEvaluator`
- `CanonizationGate` controls CANON assignment (always explicit, never automatic)

### Adversarial Simulation

The simulation harness runs scenarios with turn-by-turn execution and drift evaluation:

- **Drift verdicts** — each ground-truth fact is evaluated as `CONTRADICTED`, `CONFIRMED`, or `NOT_MENTIONED` per turn
- **Epistemic hedging** — DM declines to affirm without asserting the opposite → `NOT_MENTIONED`, not `CONTRADICTED`
- **Scene-setting turn 0** — when `setting` is non-blank and extraction is enabled, an `ESTABLISH` turn runs before turn 1 to seed initial propositions organically
- **Adversary modes** — scripted (explicit player messages in YAML) or adaptive (strategy selection based on anchor state and attack history)

### Context Compaction

`CompactedContextProvider` summarizes older context when token thresholds are exceeded. `CompactionValidator` ensures protected facts survive compaction. Memory tiers (`COLD`, `WARM`, `HOT`) influence decay rates and eviction priority.

## Anchor API Reference

### The Anchor Record

| Field | Type | Range/Default | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------------|---------|
| `id` | String | UUID | Unique identifier |
| `text` | String | — | Natural language statement |
| `rank` | int | [100, 900] | Importance under memory pressure; clamped via `clampRank()` |
| `authority` | Authority | PROVISIONAL..CANON | Trust level governing conflict resolution and eviction |
| `pinned` | boolean | false | Immune to eviction, decay, and auto-demotion |
| `confidence` | double | [0.0, 1.0] | DICE extraction confidence |
| `reinforcementCount` | int | 0+ | Times re-confirmed; drives authority upgrades |
| `trustScore` | TrustScore | nullable | Composite trust evaluation |
| `diceImportance` | double | [0.0, 1.0], default 0.0 | DICE-assigned importance; > 0.7 boosts rank |
| `diceDecay` | double | >= 0.0, default 1.0 | DICE-assigned decay modifier; adjusts effective half-life |
| `memoryTier` | MemoryTier | COLD/WARM/HOT | Tier classification influencing decay rate |

### Rank

Range `[100, 900]`, clamped by `Anchor.clampRank()`. Initial rank: 500 (configurable). Reinforcement: +50 per confirmation. Decay: exponential with tier-modulated half-life.

Rank-triggered authority demotion:
- RELIABLE demotes to UNRELIABLE when rank drops below 400
- UNRELIABLE demotes to PROVISIONAL when rank drops below 200
- CANON and pinned anchors are immune to rank-triggered demotion

### Authority

```
PROVISIONAL(0) < UNRELIABLE(1) < RELIABLE(2) < CANON(3)
```

Authority is **bidirectional** with the following invariants:

| ID | Invariant |
|----|-----------|
| A3a | CANON is never auto-assigned; requires explicit action through `CanonizationGate` |
| A3b | CANON is immune to automatic demotion (decay, trust re-evaluation); only explicit action can demote |
| A3c | Automatic demotion applies to RELIABLE → UNRELIABLE → PROVISIONAL via rank decay or trust degradation |
| A3d | Pinned anchors are immune to automatic demotion |
| A3e | All transitions (both directions) publish `AuthorityChanged` lifecycle events |

RFC 2119 compliance mapping: CANON = MUST (absolute requirement), RELIABLE = SHOULD (strong recommendation), UNRELIABLE = MAY (optional consideration), PROVISIONAL = tentative.

### Trust Pipeline

`TrustPipeline` evaluates propositions through pluggable `TrustSignal` implementations weighted by a `DomainProfile`:

| Profile | Auto-Promote | Review | Archive | Tuning |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| BALANCED | >= 0.70 | >= 0.40 | < 0.25 | Equal signal weights |
| SECURE | >= 0.85 | >= 0.50 | < 0.30 | Heavy on graph consistency |
| NARRATIVE | >= 0.60 | >= 0.35 | < 0.20 | Heavy on source authority |

Routing: `PromotionZone.AUTO_PROMOTE` promotes immediately, `REVIEW` queues for manual review, `ARCHIVE` skips. Authority ceiling constrains max auto-reachable authority based on provenance.

### Memory Tiers

| Tier | Rank Range | Decay Multiplier | Semantics |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| HOT | >= 600 | 1.5x (slower decay) | Protected window |
| WARM | 350–599 | 1.0x (baseline) | Normal decay |
| COLD | < 350 | 0.6x (faster decay) | Accelerated cleanup |

Tier thresholds and multipliers are configurable via `dice-anchors.anchor.tier.*`.

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

`CompositeConflictDetector` chains detection strategies (configurable via `dice-anchors.conflict-detection.strategy`):

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `LEXICAL` | `NegationConflictDetector` only (zero LLM cost) |
| `LLM` | `LlmConflictDetector` only (semantic comparison) |
| `HYBRID` | Negation + LLM with subject filtering |

Conflicts are classified by `ConflictType`:

| Type | Meaning | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| `CONTRADICTION` | Incoming asserts the opposite of existing | Authority-based: RELIABLE+ kept, high-confidence replaces lower |
| `REVISION` | Incoming updates/refines existing (non-adversarial) | Authority-gated: CANON immutable, PROVISIONAL always replaceable |
| `WORLD_PROGRESSION` | Narrative change, not a conflict | Always `COEXIST` |

Resolution outcomes: `KEEP_EXISTING`, `REPLACE`, `DEMOTE_EXISTING`, `COEXIST`. Memory tier defense modifiers adjust resolution thresholds (HOT anchors get +0.1 defense, COLD get -0.1).

### Promotion Pipeline

`AnchorPromoter` runs a 5-gate pipeline: **confidence → dedup → conflict → trust → promote**.

1. **Confidence gate** — drops propositions below `autoActivateThreshold` (default 0.65)
2. **Dedup gate** — `DuplicateDetector` removes near-duplicates of existing anchors
3. **Conflict gate** — `ConflictDetector` checks for contradictions/revisions with existing anchors; `ConflictResolver` determines outcome
4. **Trust gate** — `TrustPipeline` evaluates composite trust score; routes to AUTO_PROMOTE, REVIEW, or ARCHIVE
5. **Promote** — `AnchorEngine.promote()` writes the anchor and runs budget enforcement

### Canonization Gate

`CanonizationGate` enforces HITL control over CANON authority:
- Canonization and decanonization requests are queued as `PENDING` in Neo4j
- Auto-approved in simulation contexts (`contextId` starting with `sim-`)
- In chat contexts, requires explicit `approve()` or `reject()` call
- Stale detection: if the anchor's authority changed since the request was created, the request is marked `STALE`

## DICE Integration

This section addresses how Anchors composes with the DICE framework. Anchors is a downstream consumer of DICE, not a replacement. The integration strategy follows Option B: local implementation in `dice-anchors` with an upstream-friendly proposal for DICE extension points.

### Concept Mapping: DICE Proposition Lifecycle -> Anchors Lifecycle

| DICE Concept            | Anchors Concept                | Relationship                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proposition extraction  | Raw material                   | DICE extracts propositions from conversation text; Anchors selects a subset for promotion                 |
| Proposition revision    | Conflict/reinforcement trigger | DICE revisions feed Anchors conflict detection and reinforcement pipelines                                |
| Entity mentions         | Subject filtering              | DICE entities used by `SubjectFilter` to scope anchor queries                                             |
| Proposition persistence | Shared store                   | Both use `AnchorRepository` (Neo4j/Drivine). Anchors adds rank/authority/tier metadata                    |
| Incremental analysis    | Turn-by-turn extraction        | DICE `ConversationPropositionExtraction` runs per turn; Anchors processes results through promotion gates |

DICE owns extraction and revision. Anchors owns promotion, lifecycle governance, budget enforcement, and context injection.

### Memory Layering: Separate and Complementary

DICE Agent Memory and Anchors serve **different retrieval purposes** and operate as separate layers:

| Layer                   | Mechanism                                          | Purpose                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DICE Agent Memory**   | `searchByTopic`, `searchRecent`, `searchByType`    | Broad retrieval of relevant propositions, entity relationships, and historical context on demand |
| **Anchors working set** | Rank-sorted mandatory injection into system prompt | Guaranteed presence of load-bearing facts regardless of retrieval relevance scoring              |

Anchors **augments** DICE memory, it does not replace it. DICE retrieval provides the broader knowledge base. Anchors provides the invariant enforcement layer. A proposition may exist in DICE memory and never become an anchor. An anchor always has a corresponding DICE proposition as its origin.

### Low-Trust Knowledge with Constrained Authority

Not all extracted knowledge deserves anchor status. The authority hierarchy allows low-trust knowledge to remain available without contaminating the invariant set:

- **PROVISIONAL** anchors carry provenance qualifiers in the injected context (tagged `[PROVISIONAL]`), signaling the model to treat them as tentative.
- Propositions below the AUTO_PROMOTE threshold (trust score < 0.80) enter the REVIEW queue or are archived, remaining in DICE's proposition store for retrieval without occupying anchor budget.
- Authority ceiling (persisted at promotion) constrains how high a low-provenance fact can be upgraded, preventing adversarial escalation through repetition alone.
- The `TrustSignal` composite evaluates source authority, extraction confidence, and reinforcement history to gate promotion decisions.

### Runtime Boundaries

**What remains in DICE:**
- Proposition extraction from conversational text
- Entity mention and relationship identification
- Proposition revision and incremental analysis
- Base persistence schema and query contracts

**What this repo adds:**
- Rank, authority, and trust metadata on propositions
- Promotion pipeline with duplicate/conflict/trust gates (`AnchorPromoter`, `DuplicateDetector`, `LlmConflictDetector`)
- Budget enforcement and eviction policy (`AnchorEngine`, `PromptBudgetEnforcer`)
- Mandatory context injection (`AnchorsLlmReference`, `AnchorContextLock`)
- Decay and reinforcement policies (`ExponentialDecayPolicy`, `ThresholdReinforcementPolicy`)
- Adversarial simulation and drift evaluation harness (`sim/engine/`, `sim/report/`)

### Extension Points for Future DICE Incorporation

| Extension Point                             | Purpose                                                             | Expected Contract                                                          | Current Limitation                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PropositionPipeline` post-extraction hooks | Tier candidate tagging after extraction                             | Callback receiving proposition + context, returning tier hint + confidence | No hook exists in DICE; `dice-anchors` processes extraction results after the fact             |
| `PropositionRepository` tier-aware queries  | Filter by memory tier (`COLD`, `WARM`, `HOT`) | Optional tier parameter on existing `findByContext` methods                | Current repo adds tier semantics at the application layer, not in shared persistence contracts |
| Incremental analysis context metadata       | Carry session/temporal metadata for validity decisions              | Session ID, timestamp, source provenance in analysis context               | DICE incremental analysis does not expose metadata needed for temporal validity                |
| Revision/conflict extension seam            | Temporal-aware and evidence-aware conflict classification           | Hook on `PropositionReviser` allowing external conflict policy             | Conflict detection is entirely application-side in `dice-anchors`; no DICE seam exists         |
| `MemoryTierClassifier` (proposed SPI)       | Classify propositions into tier candidates                          | Input: proposition + context; Output: tier + confidence + rationale        | Not yet proposed upstream; implemented locally as promotion logic                              |
| `MemoryTierPolicy` (proposed SPI)           | Apply transition rules between tiers                                | Input: proposition, tier, state; Output: transition decision               | Not yet proposed upstream                                                                      |
| `MemoryMutationAudit` (proposed SPI)        | Structured decision events for observability                        | Event payload for every state mutation                                     | Partially implemented via `anchor/event/` lifecycle events; not standardized                   |

All proposed interfaces default to no-op implementations so existing DICE adopters see no behavior change.

### Known Integration Gaps and Risks

**Gaps:**
1. **No DICE lifecycle hooks.** All promotion/tiering logic runs after DICE extraction completes. Tighter integration requires upstream hook points that do not yet exist.
2. **No temporal validity primitives.** DICE propositions have no `validFrom`/`validTo` semantics. Anchors cannot represent "this was true then but not now" without application-level workarounds.
3. **No shared audit schema.** Anchor lifecycle events (`anchor/event/`) and DICE extraction events use different structures. Unified observability requires schema alignment.
4. **Text-keyed batch maps.** Trust pipeline and promotion paths key by proposition text rather than stable DICE proposition ID, risking collisions on normalization edge cases.
5. **Degraded parse handling still requires review workflows.** Duplicate/conflict parse failures now quarantine or degrade to review instead of auto-accept, but operator handling paths remain implementation-specific.

**Risks:**
1. **Semantic drift from DICE upstream.** If DICE evolves its own memory tiering, `dice-anchors` patterns may diverge. Option B mitigates this by maintaining adapter boundaries.
2. **Over-generalizing app-specific semantics.** The authority taxonomy (`PROVISIONAL/UNRELIABLE/RELIABLE/CANON`) is domain policy, not framework primitive. Upstreaming must keep governance policy outside DICE core.
3. **Temporal complexity.** Adding `validFrom`/`validTo` to propositions introduces state machine complexity that DICE may not want in its core.

### Integration Summary

| Dimension       | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intent**      | Demonstrate working-memory anchoring as a composable layer over DICE extraction, with evidence for upstream adoption                                                                                      |
| **Current fit** | DICE provides extraction; Anchors consumes output and adds lifecycle governance. Integration is functional but loosely coupled (no shared hooks)                                                          |
| **Known gaps**  | No DICE lifecycle hooks, no temporal primitives, text-keyed maps, fail-open parse paths                                                                                                                   |
| **Next steps**  | (1) propose `MemoryTierClassifier`/`MemoryTierPolicy`/`MemoryMutationAudit` SPIs to DICE upstream, (2) add temporal metadata to persistence model, (3) publish deterministic ablation manifests |

**Key differentiator:** Anchors is designed for adversarial resistance as a primary concern, not an afterthought. The closest comparison is MemGPT's fixed memory blocks; Anchors extends this with explicit ranking, authority governance, and lifecycle management. Graphiti/Zep's temporal model is the strongest complement and a planned integration direction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement    | Version | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| Java           | 25      | Required by the project |
| Docker         | Recent  | For Neo4j container |
| Docker Compose | v2+     | Bundled with Docker Desktop |
| LLM API Key    | —       | OpenAI key required for simulation and chat |
| Maven          | Bundled | Use the included `./mvnw` wrapper |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd dice-anchors

# Start Neo4j
docker-compose up -d

# Build (skip tests for faster iteration)
./mvnw clean compile -DskipTests

# Run the application
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Application Routes

| Route                             | View             | Purpose |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------|
| `http://localhost:8089`           | SimulationView   | Adversarial simulation harness |
| `http://localhost:8089/chat`      | ChatView         | Interactive anchor demo |
| `http://localhost:8089/benchmark` | BenchmarkView    | Multi-condition ablation benchmarks |
| `http://localhost:8089/run`       | RunInspectorView | Detailed run inspection |

## Running Simulations

Navigate to `http://localhost:8089` (routes to `SimulationView`).

**UI Controls:**

- **Scenario selector** — dropdown of all loaded scenarios from `src/main/resources/simulations/`
- **Injection toggle** — enable/disable anchor injection mid-run
- **Run / Pause / Resume / Cancel** — turn-boundary execution controls
- **Conversation panel** — turn-by-turn messages with verdict badges
- **Context Inspector** — 4-tab view: anchor state, system prompt, context trace, compaction
- **Anchor Timeline** — visual lifecycle event log
- **Drift Summary** — aggregate metrics (survival rate, contradiction counts, strategy effectiveness)
- **Run History** — cross-run comparison
- **Manipulation Panel** — modify anchor ranks during paused simulation

Each run generates a unique `contextId` (`sim-{uuid}`) for Neo4j isolation.

## Running Benchmarks

Navigate to `http://localhost:8089/benchmark`.

**Configure the benchmark matrix:**

- **Conditions**: `FULL_ANCHORS`, `NO_ANCHORS`, `FLAT_AUTHORITY` (and `NO_TRUST` once implemented)
- **Scenario pack**: select deterministic claim pack for primary evidence; stochastic stress pack for secondary
- **Repetitions**: 10–20 per cell for reliable results

Reports are built by `ResilienceReportBuilder` and rendered by `MarkdownReportRenderer`. See `docs/evaluation.md` for metrics definitions, integrity checks, and interpretation guidance.

## Scenario Configuration

Scenarios are YAML files in `src/main/resources/simulations/`. Each file defines a complete test case.

**Key fields:**

| Field                                             | Purpose |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `id`, `category`, `adversarial`                   | Identification and classification |
| `persona`                                         | Player character (name, description, playStyle) |
| `model`, `temperature`, `maxTurns`, `warmUpTurns` | Execution parameters |
| `setting`                                         | Multi-line campaign context injected into the DM system prompt |
| `groundTruth`                                     | Facts to evaluate against (id + text) |
| `seedAnchors`                                     | Pre-seeded anchors (text, authority, rank) |
| `turns`                                           | Scripted player turns with type, strategy, prompt, targetFact |
| `assertions`                                      | Post-run validation (anchor-count, rank-distribution, kg-context-contains, etc.) |
| `trustConfig`                                     | Optional trust profile and weight overrides |
| `compactionConfig`                                | Optional compaction triggers and thresholds |

**Scene-setting turn 0:** when `setting` is non-blank and extraction is enabled, an `ESTABLISH` turn executes before turn 1. The DM narrates the setting; DICE extraction captures initial propositions as anchors.

Current corpus: 22 scenarios (plus strategy catalog), 357 scripted turns, 180 evaluated turns.

### Assertion Types

| Type                     | Params                      | Validates |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| `anchor-count`           | `min`, `max`                | Final anchor count is within range |
| `rank-distribution`      | `minAbove`, `rankThreshold` | At least N anchors have rank above threshold |
| `trust-score-range`      | `min`, `max`                | All trust scores fall within range |
| `promotion-zone`         | `zone`, `minCount`          | At least N anchors are in the specified zone |
| `authority-at-most`      | `maxAuthority`              | No anchor exceeds the specified authority level |
| `kg-context-contains`    | `patterns`                  | Final anchor texts contain all specified patterns |
| `kg-context-empty`       | (none)                      | No active anchors remain |
| `no-canon-auto-assigned` | (none)                      | No anchor has CANON authority |
| `compaction-integrity`   | `requiredFacts`             | All required facts survive compaction |

### Per-Turn Execution Sequence

Each turn executes through `SimulationTurnExecutor`:

1. Query active anchors via `AnchorEngine.inject(contextId)`
2. Format anchors as `ESTABLISHED FACTS` block (if injection enabled)
3. Build system prompt: DM persona, campaign setting, anchor block, contradiction resistance instructions
4. Build user prompt: recent conversation history + current player message
5. Call LLM via Spring AI `ChatModel`
6. Build `ContextTrace` (token counts, injected anchors, full prompts)
7. If turn type requires evaluation: send to evaluator LLM, parse JSON verdicts with severity
8. Diff anchor state vs previous turn: detect CREATED, REINFORCED, DECAYED, AUTHORITY_CHANGED, EVICTED, ARCHIVED events
9. Check compaction thresholds; compact if needed (validate protected fact survival via `CompactionValidator`)
10. Return `TurnExecutionResult`

### Run History Persistence

Configure via `dice-anchors.run-history.store` in `application.yml`:

| Value              | Storage                       | Lifecycle |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| `memory` (default) | ConcurrentHashMap             | Lost on restart |
| `neo4j`            | Neo4j nodes with JSON payload | Persistent across restarts |

## Running Tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Tests span packages: `anchor/`, `assembly/`, `chat/`, `extract/`, `sim/`.

- **Unit tests**: JUnit 5 + Mockito + AssertJ
- **Integration tests** (`*IT.java`, `@Tag("integration")`): excluded by default via Surefire configuration
- Test structure uses `@Nested` + `@DisplayName`
- Method naming: `actionConditionExpectedOutcome`

## Neo4j Access

| Property    | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Browser URL | `http://localhost:7474` |
| Username    | `neo4j` |
| Password    | `diceanchors123` |
| Bolt port   | `7687` |

Started via `docker-compose.yml`. Both chat and simulation use the same `AnchorRepository` (Drivine-backed, scoped by `contextId`).

## Observability

Optional Langfuse stack for OTEL-based observability.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.langfuse.yml up -d
```

| Property      | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| UI URL        | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Login         | `dev@diceanchors.dev` / `Welcome1!` |
| OTEL endpoint | `http://localhost:3000/api/public/otel` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Resolution |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| Neo4j connection refused       | Verify `docker-compose up -d` completed; check `docker ps` for healthy container |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` errors        | Ensure the environment variable is set before `spring-boot:run` |
| Port 8089 in use               | Stop conflicting process or change `server.port` in `application.yml` |
| Test failures on clean clone   | Run `./mvnw clean compile` first; integration tests (`*IT.java`) require a running Neo4j instance |
| Langfuse not starting          | Ensure port 3000 is free; the Langfuse stack is independent of the main `docker-compose.yml` |
| Stale simulation data          | Each run uses an isolated `contextId`; stale data from previous runs does not affect new runs |
| Build failures on Java version | Java 25 is required; verify with `java -version` |

## Technology Stack

| Component     | Version |
|---------------|---------|
| Java          | 25 |
| Spring Boot   | 3.5.10 |
| Embabel Agent | 0.3.5-SNAPSHOT |
| DICE          | 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT |
| Vaadin        | 24.6.4 |
| Neo4j         | 5.x (Drivine ORM) |
| Jinja2        | All prompts use Jinja2 templates |
| JUnit 5       | Testing framework |

## Development

### Coding Style

Key conventions (see `.dice-anchors/coding-style.md` for full reference):

- **Constructor injection only** — never `@Autowired` on fields
- **Records** for all immutable data; sealed interfaces for fixed type hierarchies
- **Modern Java 25** — switch expressions, pattern matching, `.toList()`, text blocks
- **Immutable collections** — `List.of()`, `Set.of()`, `Map.of()`
- **Minimal comments** — code is self-documenting; comment only non-obvious logic

### Adding Features (OpenSpec)

dice-anchors uses [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) for structured feature work:

1. `/opsx:new` — propose a feature, write a spec, design the solution
2. `/opsx:continue` — elaborate the spec, create tasks
3. `/opsx:apply` — work through implementation tasks
4. `/opsx:verify` — confirm implementation matches spec
5. `/opsx:archive` — finalize and document the change

## Ongoing Research

### Collaborative Anchor Mutation

The [collaborative-anchor-mutation roadmap](openspec/roadmaps/collaborative-anchor-mutation-roadmap.md) addresses legitimate revision of established anchors in multi-actor contexts. Five feature waves:

1. **Revision intent classification** — `ConflictType` enum distinguishing REVISION from CONTRADICTION
2. **Prompt compliance revision carveout** — authority-gated revision eligibility in prompt templates
3. **Dependent anchor cascade** — invalidation of dependent anchors during supersession
4. **Anchor provenance metadata** — extraction turn, speaker role tracking
5. **UI-controlled mutation** — explicit anchor editing via the chat sidebar

Six research tasks (R00–R05) are complete. Key finding: no surveyed AI memory framework distinguishes update from contradiction — revision-vs-contradiction classification is novel in this space.

### Current Direction: AGM Belief Revision

Research (R05) identified AGM belief revision theory as the strongest theoretical foundation:
- **Contraction** maps to anchor archival
- **Revision** maps to supersession (archive + create successor)
- **Entrenchment ordering** maps to authority tiers
- **Minimal change principle** constrains cascade scope

Cross-domain patterns from TMS (label propagation for cascade), Wikipedia ORES (two-axis intent/impact classification), and accounting materiality (authority × impact radius) inform the implementation direction.

### Future Work

- **Track B**: Creative retrieval — spreading activation and graph-native retrieval for serendipitous knowledge discovery
- **Track C**: A2A governance — multi-agent anchor revision protocols
- Cross-domain generalization beyond tabletop RPGs
- Memory poisoning threat model and defenses

### Known Limitations

- **Very long conversations** where the system prompt itself gets diluted and attention allocation fails even for injected content.
- **Sophisticated adversarial attacks** that don't directly contradict but subtly reframe facts over multiple turns.
- **Models with weak instruction following** that ignore system prompt directives regardless of formatting.
- **Cross-session persistence** where anchors must survive context resets and be reconstructed from storage.

### Open Questions

1. **Dynamic budget and memory pressure** — Could anchors adapt budget dynamically based on conversation pressure? ACON's failure-driven compression suggests eviction policy could be driven by what causes drift, not just rank.
2. **Premature commitment and anchor timing** — Anchors established in early turns could compound premature commitment (per Laban et al.). When should anchors be promoted? Is there a minimum conversation maturity threshold?
3. **Bi-temporal validity** — Graphiti/Zep distinguishes world-time validity from system-recording time. Anchors currently have no temporal dimension. How should temporal validity interact with authority?
4. **Graph-based reinforcement** — HippoRAG uses spreading activation and personalized PageRank. Current reinforcement is count-based (+50 per mention). Could reinforcement consider knowledge graph position (centrality)?
5. **Self-editing anchors** — MemGPT allows model self-editing of memory blocks. Could the model propose modifications to anchors? Authority constraints could limit this to PROVISIONAL anchors.
6. **Operator-defined invariants** — In production, the most valuable anchors will be defined upfront by operators. This points toward an invariant definition API.
7. **Conflict detection at scale** — As the pool grows, conflicts may be indirect (two facts individually consistent but collectively contradictory). Graph-based consistency checking may be needed.
